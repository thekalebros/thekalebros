        <h2>Handforged Damascus Ring</h2>
        <p><strong>So, you built yourself a forge, found a heavy chunk of metal for your first anvil, now what? Let's make a ring!</strong></p>

        <p>First, we need to find some sort of material to make the ring out of. "Cable Damascus" is a fun material to work with/make. An old timer from Oregon named Wayne Goddard wrote a book on the subject and gave me some inspiration.<p></p> I always keep my eyes peeled for old chunks of wire rope laying around. Junk yards sometimes have twisted up lengths for free. </p>
        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_1.jpg" width="800">
        <p>First I section the rope into manageble lengths. Use whatever saw you have available, hacksaws work well. Next I like to unwind the large strands before putting them into a fire to burn off the oil and grease embedded in them to protect against corrosion. You can toss them in a bonfire like i did, or simply put them in your forge.</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_2.jpg" width="800">
        <p>After you've removed the tar, it's time to re-rind the rope together. I replaced the center strand with a solid piece of steel rod this time. Let's see how it affects the pattern when we're done!</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_3.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Tack welding the ends together is an excellent time saver if available. If not, I would wind wire around the ends to help hold it together for the first few "heats". Because I had access to a welder, I went ahead and added some scrap metal for a handle. </P>
        
        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_4.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Finally some action! Start slow as you "mash" the wires together. I use a vise to help "twist" the billet on itself to help keep it solid.</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_5.jpg" width="800">
        <p>After I have it welded up, I cut the billet into 4 sections, welded them up side by side and back to the forge we go.</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_6.jpg" width="800">
        <P>Here we have a similar length of wire rope next to our condensed and quartered billet cooling off.</P>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/wirerope_7.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Cross section of the four pieces welded side by side. </p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/keychain_3.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Sample section sawed off the end of the billet</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/keychain_1.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Sneak peak of the pattern so far. </p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/ring_1.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Since I like the pattern so far, I cut a thicker section off and drill a hole through the center. Once we have the piece up to temperature, I use a hot punch to progressively enlarge the center of the ring. </p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/ring_2.jpg" width="800">
        <p>What I ended up with.</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/ring_3.jpg" width="800">
        <p>After a few passes on the grinder, it's time for hand tools. If you have a lathe, even better!</p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/ring_4.jpg" width="800">
        <p>Once I was satisfied with the finish (think loooong time with sandpaper) I heated it up with a hand torch before quencing in oil. Not toally necessary, but this way I won't have to worry about dings and scratches forming in the steel as easily. </p>

        <img src="Photos/Wire Ring/20200425_163933.jpg" width="800">

        <p>The finished product!</p>
        <p>While the pattern is subtle, I enjoyed learning how to work with what I had on hand to overcome a new set of obstacles. </p>

        <h2>Dirt Cheap Forge</h2>

    

        <p><strong>Metal working/forging is a very rewarding skill. With simple hand tools anyone (given enough time) can create their very own handcrafted blades and more! One crucial tool is a forge. Today we will be constructing a simple brick forge capable of handling most blade forging/finishing work.</strong></p>

                 <p>Quick and dirty (HOT!) forge/burner example I threw together recently. For a first time metal worker, I typically recommend you start with a regular Propane burner assembly. However, once you've outgrown these options, here's how one might "level up" for cheap.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200404_140247927.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Our componants for the project, you can find these items at any hardware store.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200404_142139599.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>After drilling two holes in the iron piping to fit the brass through i mock it up to make sure it all fits correctly.  </p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200404_145614955.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Next we drill a small "jet" hole into the brass tube.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200404_150758795.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Final assembly gets some extra strength teflon tape.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200405_112819388.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Not pictured is when I used JB Weld to fix the brass "jet" tube in position. The idea is to direct it down the center of the iron burner tube. Makes sense? Good. </p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200405_163502002.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Now for the easy part! I bought a dozen or so fire "refractory" bricks from the local wood stove shop. (they do exist!) I simply tacked a few braces to keep the bricks in place. You could even get away with simply stacking them in place, which I have done on multiple occasions. </p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200406_171325008.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>At this point you should be a propane source away from a working forge. It may be a good idea to test for leaks in the system. Some soap water in a spray bottle does great. Just spray along the pressurized line and watch for bubbles to form. </p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200406_191834455.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>Will it win any beauty contests? Probably not. But will it heat up steel to a workable temperature?</p>

                    <img src="Photos/Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200406_200120998.jpg" width="800">
                    <p>I'd say it works!</p>
